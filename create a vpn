vim /etc/shadowsocks.json
    {  
     "server": "0.0.0.0",  
     "server_port": 7777,  
     "password": "pwd",  
     "method": "aes-256-cfb",  
     "local_address":"127.0.0.1",  
     "local_port":1080  
     } 
    Note: the setting file need to set in server and client both if in the server ,you have to set the server:"0.0.0.0"
    if in th client you have to set the server`s ip 
    
     ssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json   
     
    according the different coding  you have to turn the socket5 to http/https
    so you need to set the privoxy:
    
    yum install epel-release  
    yum install -y privoxy  
    //删除多安装的无用repo  
    rm /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-testing.repo   
    vi /etc/privoxy/config 
    forward-socks5t   /               127.0.0.1:1080 .
    listen-address  127.0.0.1:8118  
    
    export http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8118  
    export https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8118  
    export ftp_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8118  
    systemctl restart privoxy.serivce  
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8888/tcp --permanent //this commeder need to set both in the server and client  the port have to be changed in different situation 
    systemctl restart firewalld.service  
  done!!!
