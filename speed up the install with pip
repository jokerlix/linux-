if you install something with the normal pip config , it is too slow
so here is one solution to speed up the install

	vim ~/.config/pip.conf 
	
	#this command aims to build a new file to set up pip tool
	paste next text in the pip.conf
		
		[global]
		#index-url = https://pypi.doubanio.com/simple
		#do not care this url
		index-url = http://e.pypi.python.org/simple
		#you can change the  'e.' if you are not living in China
		#trusted-host = pypi.doubanio.com
		timeout = 6000
		#set up the timeout == 6000 ,the default outtime is 15s
		download-cace = ~/.cache/pip/
		#set up the cache ,this can speed up the downloads speeds ,you do not have to download same package twice
		[install]
		use-mirrors = true
		mirrors = https://e.pypi.python.org

then you have to set up the enviroment of your machine
		export PIP_CONFIG_FILE=$HOME/.config/pip.conf

DONE!!!
